# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently support security fixes for the latest release only.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please report security issues privately.

Preferred method:
- Use GitHub Security Advisories (Security tab in this repository) and create a new private advisory.

If that option is not available, open an issue that only states that you have a security report and request a private contact channel. Do not include sensitive details in public issues.

## Disclosure
We will acknowledge receipt, investigate, and work toward a fix. We aim to coordinate disclosure once a fix is available.
